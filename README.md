# Fully Resolved Augmented BNF Syntax Definition of SIP Messages

The enclosed ABNF syntax defines the structure of SIP messages,
primarily based on the representation provided at:
https://www.tech-invite.com/y-sip/tinv-rfc-SIP-abnf.html as of March
2025.

It incorporates the syntax from RFC 3261
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261 and other related RFCs,
ensuring all referenced rules are fully resolved for a complete and
self-contained definition.

The definition is suitable for actually checking SIP message syntax
with an appropriate tool, e.g., https://github.com/xsnpdngv/synx
